      <p className="mb-4">Hey, so how did you get here? your annoyed. i can tell. ok lisen. you were prbly sent here. i dont know why. but i think.
                          there are probly around 3 reasons why your here. 1, the page your looking for cant be found/ does not exist
                          2, you were sent an old link to a blog of which the name was changed or something. or 3, your firend sent you this
                          page and told your something like "its a new game" while we are working on a 404 - not found game ..... wait 
                          if we try and make a page for that, its going to redirect here..... doesent matter, anyways just go back
                          to the root URL which is https://studio.firetime.me *you dont need to include the https if you dont want* </p>
