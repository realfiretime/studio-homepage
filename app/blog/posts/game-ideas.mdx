So we *i* have many ideas for games. i thought i would write a few down. this page will probalably be updated.

## Golf City

Minimotorways but on a golf course. so bassicly you would have where the gold carts start, you would build roads and traverse the course and making sure golfers can get to there tee box on time, if time runs out or there tehre for too long, you get a strike, 3 strikes your out.

## SWIM

S.W.I.M
it stands for Super Water and Incoherent Minigames, i know its terrable. so its bassicly 2D subnatica. or terarria with all water. i rest my case
